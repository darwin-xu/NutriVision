# Development Plan

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Food Analysis & Nutrition Tracker.

## 1. Image Recognition

*   **Integrate a real AI/ML service:** The current system uses mock data. The next step is to integrate a real image recognition service (e.g., Google Cloud Vision, AWS Rekognition, or a custom-trained model). This will involve:
    *   Sending the uploaded food image to the service's API.
    *   Receiving the analysis results, which should include the identified food type and a confidence score.
    *   Mapping the service's response to the existing data structure in `server.js`.

## 2. Nutrition Analysis

*   **Expand the nutrition database:** The current nutrition data is basic. To provide more value, we need to:
    *   Find a comprehensive nutrition database (e.g., USDA FoodData Central, Edamam, or a similar API).
    *   Create a system to look up the nutritional information for the food identified by the image recognition service.
    *   Calculate the nutritional values based on the weight of the food provided by the equipment.
    *   Store and manage this data efficiently.

## 3. Health Tracking & Suggestions

*   **Implement user accounts:** To track health over time, we need user accounts. This will require:
    *   Adding user authentication (e.g., with Passport.js or a similar library).
    *   Creating a database schema to store user profiles and their food history.
*   **Develop a health suggestion engine:** Based on the user's food history, the system should provide personalized health suggestions. This could involve:
    *   Analyzing the user's diet over time (e.g., calorie intake, macronutrient balance).
    *   Developing a rules-based system or a simple algorithm to generate relevant health tips.
    *   Allowing users to set health goals and tracking their progress.
