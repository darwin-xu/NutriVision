# Design Document: Smart Food Analyzer Using Arduino

## 1. Overview
This project builds a smart system using Arduino that takes a picture of food and measures its weight. It then analyzes the nutritional content using image recognition and provides health suggestions. The system serves as a practical STEM project combining hardware control and AI services.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Automate food analysis using Arduino.
- Provide a hands-on learning tool for STEM education.
- Deliver basic dietary insights based on weight and visual recognition.

---

## 3. System Components

### Hardware
- **Arduino Board** (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- **Camera Module** (e.g., OV7670 or USB webcam via serial interface)
- **Load Cell + HX711 Amplifier** (for weight sensing)
- **Wi-Fi Module** (e.g., ESP8266 or ESP32)
- **Power Source** (USB or battery pack)

### Software
- **Arduino Firmware**: Handles sensor input and data transmission.
- **Backend Server (Node.js or Python Flask)**:
  - Receives image and weight data.
  - Calls food recognition API.
  - Estimates calories and nutrition.
  - Returns health suggestions.

## 5. Workflow

1. User places food on the scale.
2. Arduino captures:
   * A photo of the food.
   * Weight using the load cell.
3. Data is transmitted to the backend server.
4. Server:
   * Sends image to image recognition API.
   * Calculates nutritional info using image + weight.
   * Provides a health suggestion.
5. Output is returned to the user.

## 6. Functional Requirements

* [ ] Accurate weight measurement (±5g).
* [ ] Clear image capture.
* [ ] Stable data transmission over Wi-Fi.
* [ ] Integration with external food recognition API.
* [ ] Health suggestion logic based on results.

## 7. Non-functional Requirements

* Affordable and easy to build.
* Mostly offline functionality (except for API call).
* Modular and extensible design.

## 8. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                        | Mitigation                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Poor image recognition      | Limit to simple, known food items    |
| Unstable Wi-Fi              | Add retry or buffer mechanism        |
| Power fluctuations          | Use regulated power supply           |
| Inaccurate nutrition output | Allow fallback manual food selection |

## 9. Future Enhancements

* Local ML model for offline recognition.
* Voice assistant integration.
* Higher resolution camera.
* Additional sensors (e.g., temperature or barcode scanner).
